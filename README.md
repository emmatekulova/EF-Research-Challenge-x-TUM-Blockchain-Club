# EF-Research-Challenge-x-TUM-Blockchain-Club

**By Emma Tekulová | 12.09.2025 | Munich**

**Honorary Mention – Ethereum Foundation Research Challenge**

This repository contains my work on detecting **sandwich attacks** on the Ethereum blockchain as part of the **[Ethereum Foundation Research Challenge](https://apply.tum-blockchain.com/ef-research-challenge)** in collaboration with the **[TUM Blockchain Club](https://www.tum-blockchain.com)**.

Sandwich attacks are a common **MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)** strategy where a transaction is placed **before** and **after** a victim trade to profit from price changes caused by that trade.

## Overview

This project provided me hands-on experience with blockchain data analysis, from collecting raw block and transaction data to trying to identify patterns indicative of MEV activity. It involved working with:

* **Blockchain data sources:** [Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/), [Ethereum-ETL](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-etl)
* **Python libraries:** Pandas, NumPy
* **APIs:** Infura, Etherscan

The analysis helped me understand MEV concepts, the mempool, gas fees, and how strategic transaction ordering can generate profit.
